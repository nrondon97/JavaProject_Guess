#### Description

This program is a number guessing game where the player can choose to play between 3 to 5 rounds. For each round, the player selects a range of numbers and attempts to guess a randomly generated number within that range. The program provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the correct number is higher or lower than the guess. At the end of each round, the program displays the number of attempts made and the average deviation per guess. After completing all rounds, the program concludes by highlighting the best performance in terms of both lowest guesses and closest average guesses across all games.
